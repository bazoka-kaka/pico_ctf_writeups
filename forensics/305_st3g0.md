# St3g0

## Problem

Download this image and find the flag.

hint: We know the end sequence of the message will be $t3g0.

## Solution

we could try the following commands:

1. showing the general info of the file

`file pico.flag.png`

2. using image viewer

`eog pico.flag.png`

3. extracting data out of an image (but only works for jpg)

`steghide --extract pico.flag.png`

using password: `steghide --extract -sf pico.flag.png`

4. showing the strings representation of a file

`strings pico.flag.png`

5. checking data hidden in the least significant bit

zsteg -- the opposite of steghide (just works on png files, instead of jpg)

installation: `sudo gem install zsteg`

usage: `zsteg -a pico.flag.png` -- try all known method

FLAG: `picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_a9a181eb}`
