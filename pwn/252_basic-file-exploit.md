# Basic File Exploit

The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it! The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here.

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solution

from the following if statement

```
if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }
```

we can get the flag if the strtol returns 0 (this happens when we enter a value that's not valid which then returns 0)

Here's the steps:

1. select 1 (bc the program must have value in the db)
2. enter the data as usual
3. select 2
4. enter non numeric value like "ASDF"
5. voila!

here's the flag:
picoCTF{M4K3_5UR3_70_CH3CK_Y0UR_1NPU75_1B9F5942}
