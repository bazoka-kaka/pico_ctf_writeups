# Cookies

## Problem

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/

## Solution

It seems like when we search for certain cookie as text input, we get different cookie number value of label name

we just have to bruteforce it and see all the possible outputs using intruder of burpsuite

The flag is on cookie with value of 18

Here's the flag: picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}
