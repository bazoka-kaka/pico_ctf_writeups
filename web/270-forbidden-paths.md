# Forbidden Paths

## Problem

Can you get the flag? We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag? Here's the website.

## Solution

Enter the following path in the input: ../../../../flag.txt

FLAG: `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}`
